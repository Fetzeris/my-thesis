# Bachelor's thesis code
This repository contains the accompanying code to my bachelor thesis, which

1. generates the **baseline sample data set**,
2. computes **all numbers** (fractions/percentages) used in the thesis text, 
3. produces **all figures** included in the thesis, and 
3. automates the creation of **all tables** for a manuscript of the submitted paper's version.

The main analysis is written in R, but it also uses rscript to generate routines in LaTeX.

# Notes 
The baseline data set used for the empirical analysis of the thesis consists of 41 sub-data sets from three sources: 
* 42 data sets on firms' accounting data for fiscal years 1996 to 2009, retrieved from *SP Capital IQ*, 
* one additional data set on firms' accounting data, from *Compustat*, thankfully provided by my professor and
* one dataset on firms' financial covenant violations, provided at https://amirsufi.net/chronology.html as supplementary material to Greg Nini, David Smith, and Amir Sufi's 2012 paper *"Creditor Control Rights, Corporate Governance, and Firm Value"* (The Review of Financial Studies, 25(6)). Available for direct download via https://amirsufi.net/data-and-appendices/CSTATVIOLATIONS_NSS_20090701.dta

For copyright reasons, the datasets cannot be made available here, but are available from me upon request.
