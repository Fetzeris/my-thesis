# Bachelor's thesis code
This repository contains the accompanying code to my bachelor thesis, which

1. retrieves the **main dataset** with 41 sub-datasets,
2. computes **all fractions/percentages** used in the thesis text, and
3. automates the creation of **all figures and tables** for a manuscript of the submitted paper's version.

Download this repository by clicking the green "Clone or download" button above.
The main analysis is written in R, but it also uses rscript to generate routines in LaTeX.

# Notes 
The 41 subsets are composed of 39 data sets extracted from *SP Capital IQ's Compustat*, and an additional subset provided by my professor. All include quarterly data from US firms from 1996-2008. For copyright reasons, the datasets cannot be made available here, but are available from me upon request. 
The dataset on firms' financial covenant violations is provided at https://amirsufi.net/chronology.html as supplementary material to Greg Nini, David Smith, and Amir Sufi's 2012 paper *"Creditor Control Rights, Corporate Governance, and Firm Value "* (The Review of Financial Studies, 25(6)).
